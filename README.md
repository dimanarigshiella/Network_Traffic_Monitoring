# 📡 Network Traffic Monitoring System

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on the development of a **Network Traffic Monitoring System**, intended to monitor, analyze, and report network activities in real-time. The aim is to enhance **network visibility**, **detect anomalies**, ensure **security compliance**, and **optimize performance**.

### ✅ Objectives and Goals
- Detect unauthorized access and malicious network behavior.
- Optimize network performance and bandwidth usage.
- Ensure compliance with industry regulations.
- Provide real-time alerts and historical analysis.

### 🛰️ Scope and Coverage
- Monitor traffic across core network segments.
- Cover endpoints, routers, switches, and wireless access points.
- Support monitoring of TCP/IP, HTTP/S, DNS, FTP, and other essential protocols.

### 🛡️ Regulatory Compliance
- Align with relevant standards such as:
  - **GDPR**
  - **HIPAA**
  - **PCI-DSS**

### 👥 User Requirements
- Admin dashboard for real-time visualization and log access.
- Custom alerting system based on defined thresholds.
- Exportable reports for IT and compliance teams.

### 📊 Performance Metrics
- Track metrics like latency, packet loss, and throughput.
- Alert on threshold breaches (e.g., bandwidth spikes or unusual IP activity).

### 🔒 Security Requirements
- Detect and flag suspicious or unauthorized traffic.
- Anomaly detection using predefined patterns.
- Data integrity through encryption and secure access control.

### 🗃️ Data Retention and Storage
- Store logs for a configurable duration (e.g., 30/90/180 days).
- Ensure logs are encrypted and backed up periodically.

### 🔗 Integration
- Integrate with:
  - SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack)
  - Firewall and antivirus solutions
  - Email notification systems (e.g., SMTP-based alerts)

### 🚀 Scalability
- Designed to scale with network growth.
- Support for distributed monitoring across multiple network locations.

### ⚙️ Implementation Constraints
- Limited by existing hardware/network infrastructure.
- Minimal latency and performance impact during data collection.

### 📝 Reporting and Documentation
- Generate daily, weekly, and monthly traffic reports.
- Maintain detailed documentation on setup, configuration, and usage.

### 🎓 Training and Support
- Provide user manuals and training sessions for IT staff.
- Access to technical support during deployment and maintenance.

### 🧪 Testing and Validation
- Run simulations to test detection and alert mechanisms.
- Validate accuracy of traffic analysis and log generation.
